# Project Euler Solutions in Rust

## About
This repository contains solutions for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems implemented in Rust. Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

## Structure
Each problem from Project Euler is solved in a separate Rust file for clarity and ease of understanding. The solutions are numbered according to the problem numbers on Project Euler.


## How to Use
1. **Install Rust:** Make sure you have the Rust programming language [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your machine.
2. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone [Your Repository URL]`
3. **Navigate to the Problem:** Each problem is in its own directory.
4. **Run the Solution:** Use `cargo run` to compile and run the solutions.
